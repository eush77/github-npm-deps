# github-npm-deps

Userscript that links dependencies from `package.json` to respective GitHub homepages.

Does not require any external dependencies. Uses http://ghub.io underneath.

## Inspiration

- [github-npm] — original extension for Chrome.
- [npm-hub] — crossrider-powered extension, didn't work for me on Firefox.
- [Github JSON Dependencies Linker][github-linker] — userscript that works but redirects to https://npmjs.com pages which is not what I want.
